# Analysis Roadmap

Currently I am following the awesome website to get started with the SQL Journey called [SelectStarSQL](https://selectstarsql.com/), It has following sections

- [x] Front Matter
- [x] Claims of Innocence
- [x] The Long Tail
- [ ] Execution Hiatuses
- [ ] Closing Remarks and Challenge Questions

I might change this ReadMe.md and that's fine(phewww)
